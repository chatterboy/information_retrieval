The Korean melon (Cucumis melo L. var. makuwa) or chamwae (참외) is a type of melon primarily grown in Korea, China, and Japan.[1] The fruit is approximately 10 cm long and typically weighs slightly over 1 pound (0.45 kg).[1][2] It is smooth, yellow, and oblong with white stripes that run the length of the fruit.[1] It has white flesh that is juicy and sweet, and the seed cavity is filled with small white seeds.[1] The flavor has been described as a cross between a honeydew melon and a cucumber.[1] The fruits are usually eaten fresh; with its thin rind and small seeds, the melon can be eaten whole.[1][2] The Korean melon, when fermented, is called chamoe jangajji.

The word chamoe comes from two words: cham meaning "high quality" and oe meaning "cucumber".[3]

Phylogenetic studies tracing the genetic lineage of the plant suggest that the Korean melon may have originated in East India.[1][3][4] They were then thought to have been introduced to China from the west via the Silk Road.

The Korean melon is a cool sub-temperate crop, growing best with day temperatures between 24 to 29 degrees Celsius and night temperatures between 16 to 24 degrees Celsius.[1] It requires good sunlight and rich, well-drained, friable, and moisture-retaining soil.[1] It is drought tolerant, but requires sufficient water for optimal growth.

The plant, a cucurbit, is an annual herbaceous plant that branches and trails.[1] The stem is angular and hirsute (hairy) and 7mm in diameter.[1] The leaves are reniform (kidney-shaped) with 5-7 lobes.[1] It is andromonoecious (both bisexual and male flowers on same plant) with yellow flowers.

There are two major landraces of Korean melon, Sunghwan and Gotgam.[6] The Gotgam Korean melon has the aroma of a dried persimmon, as reflected by its name.[6] These two landraces contain more nutrients and have greater disease resistance than other varieties.

South Korea National Treasure nos. 94 and 114 are both formed like the Korean melon.[3][7]

The annual Yeoju Geumsa Oriental Melon Festival is held once a year, and visitors can sample the melons there.[8]

There is a Korean Melon Ecology Center in Seongju County, designed to educate the public regarding the cultivation and other aspects of the fruit.

The Korean melon has also been used as cattle feed.[1]

In Korean folk medicine, the fruit has been used for acute gastritis, fever, mental disorders, dysuria, jaundice, alcoholism, and hyperesthesia/paralysis.[10] The apex has been used as an emetic and for hepatitis, constipation, syphilis, jaundice, and edema.[10] The leaves have been used for blisters and alopecia,[10] and the seeds for indigestion and cough.[10]

Research suggests that the hexane extract of the seeds could be used as a way to control type 2 diabetes.[11][12] When hexane was used to extract fatty acids, it was found to contain linoleic acid, oleic acid, and palmitic acid.[11] The hexane extract was found to inhibit the enzymes alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase.[11][12] Theoretically, this could decrease the levels of blood sugars for patients with type 2 diabetes.
